# Jobs To Be Done — Complete Skill

This skill contains **10 specialized prompts** for conducting comprehensive Jobs To Be Done analyses.
Each prompt corresponds to a specific step or dimension of the JTBD methodology.

---

## Prompt Map — When to Use Each

| # | Prompt | When to use |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **Contextual Segmentation** | Create market segments based on situational factors (not demographics) |
| 2 | **Thinking Styles (Indi Young)** | Identify significantly different thinking patterns of a performer toward a purpose |
| 3 | **JTBD Discovery** | Discover and reframe Jobs from a solution, action, or outcome |
| 4 | **Competitor Discovery** | Map direct, indirect, and hidden competitors through the JTBD lens |
| 5 | **Job Actors** | Identify all actors involved in the job and market |
| 6 | **Situational Variables** | Discover factors and variables that impact job execution |
| 7 | **Functional Needs** | Discover functional success criteria (desired outcomes) |
| 8 | **Financial Needs** | Discover financial success criteria for solution acquisition |
| 9 | **Emotional & Social Jobs** | Discover emotional and social jobs related to the functional job |
| 10 | **Job Map Steps** | Map the stages and steps of the job to build a Job Map |

## Recommended Flow

For a complete JTBD analysis, follow this logical sequence:

```
1. Contextual Segmentation      → define the market
   ↓
2. Thinking Styles              → segment by cognition/behavior
   ↓
3. JTBD Discovery               → define the jobs
   ↓
4. Job Actors                   → identify who is involved
   ↓
5. Situational Variables        → understand the context
   ↓
6. Job Map Steps                → map the journey
   ↓
7. Functional Needs             → success criteria
   ↓
8. Financial Needs              → financial criteria
   ↓
9. Emotional & Social Jobs      → human dimension
   ↓
10. Competitor Discovery        → who else solves the job
```

## Interaction Tool Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: When the user needs to choose between predefined options, ALWAYS ask through the portable ask contract (`../stelow-workflow-orchestrator/references/cli-tools/ask.md` — host-native question tool, else `stelow ask`, else enumerated text) with enumerated format:
- Options with short `label` and `description`
- Examples: prompt selection (1-10), analysis type, next steps, etc.

---

## General Instructions for the Agent

- **Ask which prompt the user wants to run** (unless already clear from context) — offer three modes: **Full Mapping** (run all ten prompts sequentially), **Targeted** (exactly one prompt), or **Recommend** (agent picks from context):
  - Use the portable ask contract with options 1-10 for the 10 JTBD prompts
  - Always include option: "I want you to recommend based on context" (in the user's language)
  - Fallback: "Which JTBD analysis do you want to perform? (1-10, or 'recommend based on context')"
- **Fill in the variables** indicated by `[brackets]` or `{{braces}}` with the information provided by the user before executing the prompt.
- **Chain prompts sequentially** when the user wants a full analysis — the output of one prompt feeds into the next (e.g., Situational Variables → Functional Needs).
- **Language of output**: The prompts are written in English (instructions to the LLM), but results should be delivered in the language used by the user.
- Read the appropriate file from `references/` before executing a prompt.

---

## Research Mode (current or niche context)

JTBD is grounded first in the user's context and in interviews. The LLM and
external research can generate useful candidates — they do not invent evidence
about people or replace validation.

Use the shared web-research contract (`../stelow-workflow-orchestrator/references/cli-tools/web-research.md`)
when current or niche-specific material can help discover or test candidates:

- language people use for a struggle, workaround, or desired progress;
- possible Jobs, situational variables, Job Map steps, and desired outcomes;
- named competitors or alternatives, a changing category, or an emerging
  practice; and
- a score that relies on the current solution landscape.

Use host-native search and primary sources to establish what exists and what
has changed. Add `last30days` when recent launches, practitioner discussion,
or a current niche signal could change the candidate set or its priority. It
complements primary evidence; a frequent discussion or launch is never proof
of a Job, a struggle, prevalence, or causal relationship.

### Hypothesis and Bet Discipline

When research contributes to a JTBD output, call it a **draft guide**, not a
market finding. Mark each research-led Job, step, desired outcome, or ranking
as a **hypothesis**. Prioritize hypotheses as **bets** using the decision
context, fit with the supplied evidence, source coverage, and recency — not as
a scientific measurement of demand or truth.

For a prioritized research-led bet, record:

- **Bet:** the candidate Job, step, outcome, or segment;
- **Why now:** the supplied context and signals that made it worth exploring;
- **Evidence, origin, and bias:** whether it is user-provided input, external
  research, or a simulation; source types, gaps, recency, and whose
  perspective is overrepresented or missing;
- **Confidence:** directional only (low, medium, or high), never a statistical
  claim; and
- **Next validation:** the cheapest interview, observation, or behavioral-data
  check that could disconfirm it.

### Source and Status for Evidence

User-provided interviews and research are first-class inputs. Use them when
they support the analysis, and make their origin clear without inventing a
sample size, method, or representativeness. Use one of these statuses wherever
an insight, example, or voice depends on supplied material:

- **Input-derived — direct quote:** exact wording present in the material the
  user supplied; preserve its meaning and do not add a participant identity.
- **Input-derived — paraphrase:** a faithful restatement of one supplied
  account; do not put it in quotation marks.
- **Input-derived — synthesis:** a pattern drawn from multiple supplied
  interviews or research artifacts; state the supplied scope and limitations.
- **Simulated hypothesis — not participant data:** a plausible invented
  example used to make a candidate concrete, never evidence about a group.

This provenance discipline applies to every JTBD prompt. Only call a finding
validated when the supplied material actually supports it; otherwise preserve
it as a hypothesis or bet. Keep participant information anonymized and avoid
repeating unnecessary sensitive details.

### Required Research Appendix

When research contributed to the output, append this section after the native
prompt output. Do not add an empty appendix when no research was used.

```markdown
## Research-led Draft Bets

> Directional guide, not a market measurement or validated JTBD finding.

### Bet: [candidate Job, step, outcome, segment, or alternative]
- **Why now:** [decision context and signals]
- **Evidence, origin, and bias:** [user-provided input, external sources, or simulation; recency, coverage gaps, and missing or overrepresented perspectives]
- **Confidence:** [low | medium | high — directional only]
- **Next validation:** [the cheapest interview, observation, or behavioral-data check that could disconfirm it]
```

Interviews and user-provided behavioral evidence establish why people hire,
switch, or struggle. Record coverage limitations and do not fabricate findings
when research is unavailable.

## Attribution

This skill and all its prompts were developed by **calionauta** 🇧🇷 — product strategist and JTBD practitioner from Brazil.

These prompts are the result of years of experimentation and refinement, documented and shared through:

- 📚 **E-book**: [Jobs To Be Done in Portuguese](https://calionauta.substack.com/p/e-book-jobs-to-be-done-em-portugues) — comprehensive guide to JTBD methodology
- 🔗 **Resources**: [Recursos Principais](https://calionauta.substack.com/p/recursos-principais) — collection of prompts, frameworks, and tools
- ✍️ **Substack**: Regular articles and experiments on JTBD, product strategy, and innovation

The prompts in this skill represent a curated, production-ready selection of the most effective JTBD analyses developed through extensive real-world application.

## When to Use & Test Cases

Use when segmenting markets by context or mapping jobs to be done — never demographics.

Should activate: "segment this market by situation", "map the jobs for expense approvals".
Should NOT activate: "personas by age and income" (explicitly out of scope).

## Examples

### Example: why users hire a note app

**Input:** "Users say they love us but keep churning. Why?"

**Steps:**
1. Run a JTBD interview (past-tense, struggle-first, no feature questions).
2. Extract the job (e.g. "feel in control Monday morning").
3. Map competing hires (spreadsheets, memory, nothing).

**Output:** Job statement + forces diagram + what the product must do to win the hire.

## Edge Cases

### Interviewee talks features
- Redirect to the last time they struggled; features are solutions, not jobs.
### Multiple jobs surface
- Rank by struggle intensity; design for the strongest, note the rest.
### Job is emotional, not functional
- Keep it: progress has functional, emotional, and social dimensions.

## Entry (mode detection)

When this skill loads, check for the stelow workflow marker:

```bash
if [ -n "$STELOW_WORKFLOW" ] && [ -n "$STELOW_STATE" ]; then
  echo "stelow: workflow mode (state=$STELOW_STATE)"
else
  echo "stelow: standalone mode (no STELOW_WORKFLOW marker)"
fi
```

In **standalone mode** (no marker), run the existing skill body unchanged.
In **workflow mode**, skip to `### Workflow slice` and emit a complete
`## Hand-off (workflow mode)` block at the end. See
`../stelow-workflow-entry/SKILL.md` for the full marker protocol.

## Hand-off (workflow mode)

```
stage          : context
description    : Strategic context. Market analysis, JTBD, domain detection. Gated by `context:5` (appetite/review mode): Product Spec Ga
status         : <done|partial|blocked>
artifacts      : <paths created or modified>
next-candidate : shape
gate           : none
rework-on      : setup
```

Workflow mode: emit the above Hand-off block verbatim, then stop. The
router skill consumes the next-candidate field and calls
`scripts/stelow advance <next-candidate>` to move state forward.

### Workflow slice

Workflow mode for the **context** stage. Standalone behavior lives in
the rest of this file (unchanged). Summary:

> Strategic context. Market analysis, JTBD, domain detection. Gated by `context:5` (appetite/review mode): Product Spec Gate+Auto skips; others use reduced ask. S

Primary actions (per stages.yaml): `read, write`. Run only the actions that
produce the artifacts promised in `## Hand-off`; skip anything that does
not advance the workflow.
